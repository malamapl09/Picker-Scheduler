   - If available, set preferred start and end times

| Wednesday | Yes | 12:00 PM | 8:00 PM |
| Thursday | Yes | 8:00 AM | 4:00 PM |
| Friday | Yes | 8:00 AM | 4:00 PM |
| Saturday | No | - | - |
| Sunday | No | - | - |

### Important Notes

- **Availability is a preference, not a guarantee**

- **Give advance notice**
  - Update availability at least one week before changes take effect

Need a day off? Here's how to request it.

### Creating a Request

1. Click **Requests** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Request** or **Request Time Off**
3. Fill in:
   - **Start Date** - First day off
   - **End Date** - Last day off (can be same as start)
   - **Reason** (optional) - Why you need off

4. Click **Submit Request**

### Request Status

Requests can be:
- **Pending** - Waiting for manager review
- **Approved** - Request granted
- **Denied** - Request not granted
- **Cancelled** - You cancelled the request

### Viewing Your Requests

1. Go to **Requests**
2. See all your requests with their status
3. Pending requests appear at the top

### Cancelling a Request

If your plans change:
1. Find the pending request
2. Click **Cancel Request**

Note: You cannot cancel an already approved request through the system. Talk to your manager.

### Tips for Time-Off Requests

1. **Request early** - The earlier you ask, the better chance of approval
2. **Check the schedule first** - Avoid requesting off on already-busy days
3. **Coordinate with coworkers** - If multiple people are off, approval is less likely
4. **Provide a reason** - While optional, it helps managers make decisions

## Shift Swaps

Want to trade shifts with a coworker? The swap system makes it easy.

### How Swaps Work

1. You post your shift as available for swap
2. Another employee offers their shift in exchange
3. Both parties agree
4. Manager approves the swap
5. Shifts are exchanged in the schedule

### Posting a Shift for Swap

1. Click **Swaps** in the sidebar
2. Click **Post Shift for Swap**
3. Select which of your shifts you want to trade
4. Add notes (optional) - explain what you're looking for
5. Click **Post**

Your shift is now visible to coworkers who might want to swap.

### Viewing Available Swaps

1. Go to **Swaps**
2. See shifts posted by coworkers
3. Each shows:
   - Employee name
   - Shift date and time
   - Store location

### Accepting a Swap

1. Find a swap that works for your schedule
2. Click **Offer Swap**
3. Select which of your shifts you'll trade
4. Click **Confirm**

Now both parties have agreed, and the swap goes to manager for approval.

### Swap Status

After you offer a swap:
- **Pending Approval** - Waiting for manager
- **Approved** - Swap complete, schedules updated
- **Denied** - Manager declined (maybe compliance issue)

### Important Notes

- **Both shifts must be in the future**
- **Compliance still applies** - If a swap would cause overtime, it may be denied
- **Manager has final say** - All swaps require manager approval
- **Check your hours** - Make sure the swap doesn't put you over limits
